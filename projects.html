									<p class="h3">Fundamental Taxation</p>
									
									<div class="row">
						
										<div class="small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-2 columns">
											<p>This is my first individual accounting project. I was given a fictitious case and asked to file a tax return package for client. The project contains two parts: the tax returns and a written document explaining all decisions I made. This project gave me a chance to practice all the taxation regulations and filling techniques that I learned during the course.</p> 
											<p>To be successful, I need to analyze client’s source of income and investments in order to declare correct taxable portions; yet, still able to help client saves on possible deductible. I also learned how to use tax filling software while working on the project. This is a good way to connect my study with real world scenarios.</p>

										<div class="small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-2 columns">
											<p>This project required some professional judgements and technical skills as an accountant. I was given a year – end financial statements with hidden errors. My job was to identify the errors and make corrections in the final financial report. This is a lengthy and complex project, which require details analysis. I had to use excel and accounting software Xerox in order to fulfill all the requirements.</p> 
											<p>Despite its difficult level, this project is my favorite because it represents the work and challenge that accountants have to deal with. The project gave me a chance to be familiar with actual accounting tasks and helped to prepare myself for future career.</p>
